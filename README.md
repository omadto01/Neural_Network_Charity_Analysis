# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Module 19 Challenge



1. **Overview of the analysis:** The purpose of this analysis is to create and run machine learning and neural networks, using the features in the provided dataset to help create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

2. **Results:** Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.
   
   - Data Preprocessing
     - What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
     - IS_SUCCESSFUL
     - What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
     - IS_SUCCESSFUL
     - What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
     - The following that should be removed are the Classification Type and Application Type.
   - Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
     - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
     - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
     - No, I was not able to achieve the target model performance for optimization accuracy of 75%
     - What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
     - The following step I tried was to increase and/or decrease  the hidden nodes layer 1 and 2 in order to come up with expected accuracy of 75% but was not able to come up with 75%.
   
3. **Summary:** Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.

   Overall summary findings suggest that the loss and accuracy for AlphabetSoupCharity were 79% loss and 64% accuracy.
